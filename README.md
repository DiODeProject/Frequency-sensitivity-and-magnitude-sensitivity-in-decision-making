# Frequency-sensitivity-and-magnitude-sensitivity-in-decision-making
This repository contains code to generate and analyse simulated data that is used in the study of "Frequency-sensitivity and magnitude-sensitivity in decision-making: predictions of a theoretical model-based study".

### Simulation code provided in this repository has been developed by Thomas Bose as part of the DiODe project (https://diode.group.shef.ac.uk/) and is open source. It may be used and modified for non-commercial use.

### For further information please contact t.bose@sheffield.ac.uk.

This repository contains code to generate and analyse simulated data that is used in the study of **Frequency-sensitivity and magnitude-sensitivity in decision-making: predictions of a theoretical model-based study** which is currently *under review*.

Simulations and data analysis were performed in Python code (Python 3) using Jupyter notebooks. For more information on Jupyter notebooks including installation instructions please visit http://jupyter.org/. 

A major part of the notebooks provided uses `ipyparallel` to run calculations in parallel in a standard Python 3 environment.
Information on how to install and use the `ipyparallel` package can be found following this link https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

All code to generate data is available in this repository. However, some of the calculations take a significant amount of time (~ several hours or days). Therefore we also provided the data files produced by the code which are placed in subfolders called `DataGeneration`. Notebooks to produce all graphics are also included. Images will be plotted inside the notebooks and may be exported using standard Matplotlib functionality.
